# Product Management App

This project is a React-based application for managing a list of products with the ability to filter, add, and remove products from a cart. The application uses Redux for state management, allowing you to track the products in the cart and filter them by category. The products are initially loaded from a JSON file, which can easily be extended with more products or categories.

## Features

- Display a list of products fetched from a JSON file.
- Add and remove products from the cart using checkboxes.
- Filter products by category (e.g., "Electronics", "Clothing").
- Display the total count and price of products in the cart.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- JSON for product data
- CSS for styling
